🚀 Credit Card Data Analysis Journey: My Learning Experience with Power BI 🚀

Over the past weeks, I embarked on a fascinating journey of analyzing credit card transactions and customer data using Power BI and PostgreSQL. Here's what I accomplished:

1️⃣ Data Integration:

Loaded and structured large datasets (in CSV format) into a PostgreSQL database.
Created a dynamic connection between PostgreSQL and Power BI for seamless analysis.
2️⃣ Data Transformation & Analysis:

Used DAX expressions and calculated measures to transform raw data into meaningful insights.
Developed metrics like revenue by card type, customer demographics, and state-wise contributions.
3️⃣ Dashboard Design:

Built interactive dashboards to visualize trends in revenue, transactions, and customer behavior.
Segmented insights by factors like expense type, income level, and geography.
Key Insights from My Analysis:
💳 Transaction Trends: Bills and entertainment are the largest contributors to revenue.
👩‍🎓 Customer Demographics: Graduate customers and businessmen lead revenue generation.
📍 Geographic Insights: States like Texas and New York generate the highest revenue.
📊 Card Usage: Blue cards and swipe transactions dominate the market.

This project was a significant step in enhancing my skills in data integration, Power BI visualization, and SQL database management.
